# Prefer using @shopify/hydrogen `useQuery` hook in place of `fetch` (`hydrogen/prefer-use-fetch`)

Using `fetch` improperly when fetching data in React components can lead to unknown performance problems. The `useQuery` hook from the `@shopify/hydrogen` SDK comes with intelligent cache defaults and other built-in features to enable the most performant experience. Learn more about the `useQuery` hook in the [Shopify.dev docs](https://shopify.dev/api/hydrogen/hooks/global/usequery).
